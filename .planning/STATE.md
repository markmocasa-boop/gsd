# Project State

## Project Summary

**Building:** Brownfield support for GSD - `/gsd:map-codebase` workflow that analyzes existing codebases using parallel Explore agents, producing structured `.planning/codebase/` documents.

**Core requirements:**
- `/gsd:map-codebase` produces useful codebase documents from any codebase
- Documents are focused (<100 lines each) and easy to update incrementally
- `/gsd:new-project` detects existing code and offers mapping
- `/gsd:plan-phase` loads relevant codebase context automatically
- Codebase map updates after plan execution

**Constraints:**
- Explore agents required for initial mapping
- Each codebase map file must stay under ~100 lines
- Only load relevant codebase sections into phase planning
- Follow existing GSD command/workflow/template patterns

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 11 (Async Parallel Execution - feature branch)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-09 - Completed 11-01-PLAN.md

Progress: ██████████████░ 95% (18 of 19 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18
- Average duration: 2.7 min
- Total execution time: 48 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | 9 min | 3 min |
| 2 | 2 | 5 min | 2.5 min |
| 3 | 1 | 2 min | 2 min |
| 4 | 2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |
| 5 | 2 | 5 min | 2.5 min |
| 6 | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |
| 7 | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |
| 8 | 1 | 1 min | 1 min |
| 9 | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |
| 10 | 2 | 4 min | 2 min |
| 11 | 1 | 4 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 09-01 (3m), 10-01 (2m), 10-02 (2m), 11-01 (4m)
- Trend: Stable (2-4 min avg)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 0 | Folder with focused files | Easier to update incrementally than monolithic file |
| 0 | Update after plan execution | Fits existing STATE.md update pattern |
| 0 | Parallel Explore agents | Thoroughness for initial mapping |
| 0 | Selective context loading | Avoid loading irrelevant sections |
| 6 | Frontmatter with dependency graph | Enable automatic context assembly via transitive closure |
| 6 | Intelligent summary selection | Scan frontmatter, build graph, auto-select relevant phases |
| 8 | Active milestone details in ROADMAP.md | Single source of truth during development, archive only on completion |
| 9 | Phase-scoped UAT issues | Keep UAT findings tied to specific plan, not global ISSUES.md |
| 10 | Dual storage for agent IDs | current-agent-id.txt (fast lookup) + agent-history.json (audit) |
| 11 | Background execution via run_in_background | Enables true async with output file tracking |
