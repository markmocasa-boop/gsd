# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-14)

**Core value:** Full feature parity on OpenCode — every GSD command works identically on both agent platforms.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Validation

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 4 (Validation) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-14 — Completed 04-01-PLAN.md

Progress: █████░░░░░ 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 9 min
- Total execution time: 37 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 1/1 | 12 min | 12 min |
| 2 | 1/1 | 8 min | 8 min |
| 3 | 1/1 | 15 min | 15 min |
| 4 | 1/2 | 2 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (12m), 02-01 (8m), 03-01 (15m), 04-01 (2m)
- Trend: Validation phase executing very quickly

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Support only Claude Code + OpenCode (v1 focus)
- Pure port, no new features
- **Claude Code as source of truth, transform at install time** (01-01)
- **No separate directories per platform** (01-01)
- **Transform at install time, not in source repo** (02-01) — installer detects platform and applies transformations

### Key Findings (Phase 1)

- OpenCode uses `.opencode/command/` and `.opencode/agent/`
- Frontmatter: remove `name`, `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`
- Tool names mostly identical
- `$ARGUMENTS` and `@path` work the same
- OpenCode has explicit agent system (vs Claude Code Task tool)

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenCode agent visibility bug (custom agents may not Tab-cycle)
- YAML parsing crash with unquoted values in commands
