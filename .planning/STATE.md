## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions moved to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (v1.0 milestone).

Recent decisions from v1.0:
- Claude Code as source of truth, transform at install time
- No separate directories per platform
- Transform at install time, not in source repo

### v1.0 Accomplishments

- Researched and documented complete OpenCode platform mapping
- Built multi-platform installer with automatic frontmatter transformation
- Created OpenCode agent definitions with proper permission models
- Validated all 26 commands for platform compatibility
- Documented dual-platform installation and troubleshooting

### Deferred Issues

None from v1.0. All planned work completed.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 missing SUMMARY.md file (minor documentation gap)
- OpenCode agent visibility bug (platform issue, not GSD)
