# Explore Workflow

**Complexity:** Variable
**Phases:** Flexible
**Time:** Variable
**Identities:** As needed

---

## When to Use

- Creative experiments
- Learning projects
- Proof of concepts
- "I have an idea, let's see where it goes"
- Prototyping

---

## Process

```
User Request
     │
     ▼
[FLEXIBLE] ─── Iterate ─── Iterate ─── Done when user says so
```

**No rigid structure.** Adapt as you go.

---

## How It Works

### Start Light
- Don't over-plan
- Build something small
- Get feedback quickly

### Iterate Fast
- Make changes based on what you learn
- Don't be afraid to throw away code
- Experiment freely

### Stay Curious
- Ask questions
- Suggest alternatives
- Explore possibilities

---

## Identity Selection

In explore mode, switch identities fluidly based on need:

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| "Let's think through this" | PLANNER (light) |
| "How should we structure this?" | ARCHITECT (light) |
| "Let's build it" | BUILDER |
| "Does this work?" | TESTER (light) |

**Note:** "Light" means abbreviated output, not full formal deliverables.

---

## Quality Gates

**Minimal gates only:**
- Code runs
- No obvious errors
- No security vulnerabilities

**Skip:**
- Full documentation
- Comprehensive testing
- Production readiness

---

## Exiting Explore Mode

When the user is ready to make it "real":

> "This looks good. Let's make it production-ready."

At this point, switch to **feature-build** or **full-stack** workflow to add:
- Proper error handling
- Tests
- Documentation
- Security review

---

## Example

**User:** "I want to experiment with a chatbot that helps with cooking"

**You (flexible):**
```
Let's start simple. I'll create a basic chat interface that:
- Takes a user message
- Calls an LLM with a cooking-focused prompt
- Returns the response

[builds quick prototype]

Here's a working version. Try asking it something like 
"What can I make with chicken and rice?"

What do you think? Should we add:
- Recipe saving?
- Ingredient substitutions?
- Dietary filters?
```

**User:** "Add recipe saving"

**You:**
```
Added a simple save feature using localStorage.

[builds feature]

Now when you see a recipe you like, click "Save" and it'll 
appear in your saved recipes list.

Want to keep exploring or make this more robust?

## Warnings

Explore mode is NOT for:
- Production systems
- Anything handling real user data
- Anything touching money
- Anything requiring security

If the project becomes serious, exit explore mode.
