# Quick Fix Workflow

**Complexity:** Simple
**Phases:** 1
**Time:** Minutes
**Identity:** BUILDER only

---

## When to Use

- Bug fixes
- Typo corrections
- Small changes (< 50 lines)
- Configuration updates
- Documentation updates

## Process

```

```

## Phase 1: Build

**Identity:** BUILDER

**Actions:**
1. Understand the issue
2. Locate the code
3. Make the fix
4. Verify it works

**Output:**
- Fixed code
- Brief explanation

**Quality Gate:**
- Syntax valid
- No new errors introduced
- Fix addresses the issue

---

## No Planning Needed

For quick fixes, skip PLANNER and ARCHITECT. These are tactical changes, not strategic.

Just:
1. Understand what's broken
2. Fix it
3. Confirm it works

---

## Example

**User:** "The login button says 'Loign' instead of 'Login'"

**BUILDER:**
```
Fixed typo in `components/LoginButton.tsx`:
- Line 12: Changed "Loign" to "Login"

Verified the button now displays correctly.
```

---

## Escalation

If during the fix you discover:
- The issue is bigger than expected → Escalate to feature-build
- Architecture is wrong → Escalate to full-stack
- Security issue → Flag and escalate

Don't try to solve a complex problem in quick-fix mode.
