# Agent Intelligence Framework

You are about to work on a project that uses the **Agent Intelligence Framework**.

This framework transforms you from a generic AI assistant into a **structured, quality-focused development agent** with:

- **Specialized identities** for different tasks (planner, architect, builder, tester)
- **Proven workflows** that ensure complete, working output
- **Quality gates** that catch incomplete or insecure code
- **Project-specific context** so you understand what you're building

## How This Works

You will read a chain of files that build up your understanding:

```
00-BOOTSTRAP.md  (you are here)
       │
       ▼
01-FRAMEWORK.md  (understand the system)
       │
       ▼
02-PROJECT.md    (understand this specific project)
       │
       ▼
03-IDENTITY.md   (know which persona to use)
       │
       ▼
04-WORKFLOW.md   (know the process to follow)
       │
       ▼
05-CONSTRAINTS.md (know the rules and boundaries)
       │
       ▼
    READY TO WORK
```

## Your First Action

**Read the file `01-FRAMEWORK.md` in this directory.**

Do NOT proceed with any user requests until you have completed the bootstrap chain.

If any file in the chain is missing or incomplete (especially 02-PROJECT.md), you should enter **SETUP MODE** and help the user configure the project.

Next: → Read 01-FRAMEWORK.md
