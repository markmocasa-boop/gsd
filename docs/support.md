# Support The Project

If GSD is saving you time (or making Claude Code feel *actually reliable*), sponsorship and word-of-mouth are the highest-leverage ways to help.

## The Short Version

<div class="support-actions" markdown="1">

**1. Star the repo** so more developers find it.

**2. Sponsor the work** so ongoing maintenance is sustainable.

**3. Share a concrete win** (tweet, blog post, internal note) so others understand what it does.

</div>

  <p>"I want to just go full-time working on GSD. I had no idea how I was going to do it, but my partner definitely was a little bit shocked when I was like, 'Yeah, I'm all in on this thing that I've built and thousands of people are using it worldwide right now.'"</p>
