# Support The Project

If GSD is saving you time (or making Claude Code feel *actually reliable*), sponsorship and word-of-mouth are the highest-leverage ways to help.

## Why I Built This

I'm a solo developer. I don't write code — Claude Code does.

Other spec-driven development tools exist; BMAD, Speckit... But they all seem to make things way more complicated than they need to be (sprint ceremonies, story points, stakeholder syncs, retrospectives, Jira workflows) or lack real big picture understanding of what you're building. I'm not a 50-person software company. I don't want to play enterprise theater. I'm just a creative person trying to build great things that work.

So I built GSD. The complexity is in the system, not in your workflow. Behind the scenes: context engineering, XML prompt formatting, subagent orchestration, state management. What you see: a few commands that just work.

The system gives Claude everything it needs to do the work *and* verify it. I trust the workflow. It just does a good job.

That's what this is. No enterprise roleplay bullshit. Just an incredibly effective system for building cool stuff consistently using Claude Code.

  <p>"I want to just go full-time working on GSD. I had no idea how I was going to do it, but my partner definitely was a little bit shocked when I was like, 'Yeah, I'm all in on this thing that I've built and thousands of people are using it worldwide right now.'"</p>
